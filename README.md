There are two files in src folder - classify.py and feature_extractor.py

Feature extractor makes features for megam in the format megam understands. 
Also, every homophone pair has its own model which is generated by changing the feature_extractor.py accordingly.

In classify.py, there is a subprocess which runs megam. The subprocess takes features has input, one line at a time
and outputs the label.
